## Supervised-Learning
 Supervised Learning is used when the given data consists of Attributes and Labels.The model tries to learn the relationship between the data and labels. Problems like classification and Regression comes under Supervised Learning.
 
 
 The Supervised Learning Algorithms:
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - K Nearest neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decison Trees and Random Forest
  - AdaBoost(Boosting)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Neural Networks
